## Lab Setup Progress

### Day 1 – Infrastructure Setup

- Installed and configured 4 virtual machines:
  - Ubuntu Server (SIEM)
  - Windows 7 (vulnerable endpoint)
  - Windows 10 (modern endpoint)
  - Kali Linux (attacker)
    
- Allocated VM resources based on host hardware constraints
- Took clean baseline snapshots of Windows VMs
- Designed lab with attack simulation and telemetry collection in mind

Networking, attack simulation, and log analysis will be added incrementally.
